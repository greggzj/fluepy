from collections import deque

'''
The execution of this code might take a bit of study, but the key is the queue of pending
messages. Essentially, the scheduler runs as long as there are messages to deliver. A
remarkable feature is that the counter generator sends messages to itself and ends up
in a recursive cycle not bound by Pythonâ€™s recursion limit.
